# Reinforcement-Learning-Autonomous-Robot
Realization of an autonomous line follower robot on ROS using
Reinforcement Learning algorithms and comparison between
the performances of the different algorithms. This project
includes the preparation of the ROS software environment, the
implementation of the algorithms with Open AI Gym and the
learning in simulation on GAZEBO.
